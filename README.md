# Starter ROR guide

I am creating project from scratch covering all basic coding of ROR (Ruby on Rails).

# Topics
1. [Initial Setup](./readme/installation.md) - Installing Ruby, Rails and Heroku
2. [Basic Scaffolding](./readme/rails_scaffold.md) - Create rails project and run a simple app.


Work in progress....
