# Starter ROR guide

I am creating project from scratch covering all basic coding of ROR (Ruby on Rails).

# Topics
1. [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Rinkuk1993/starter_rails_app/wiki/Initial-Setup) - Installing Ruby, Rails and Heroku
2. [Basic Scaffolding](https://github.com/Rinkuk1993/starter_rails_app/wiki/Basic-Scaffolding) - Create rails project and run a simple app.


Work in progress....
